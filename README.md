- 👋 Hi, I’m @SophiaEllis
- 👀 I’m interested in front end development and UI Design

I've always had a creative personality, I started designing product packaging and websites for various projects in school and college, I realized I enjoyed creating practical and modern designs, especially for a digital format. I discovered I could apply what I enjoyed, and turn it into a career.

After a few years of studying various art-based subjects, I looked into a career path that would allow me to be creative. I started studying UI design, and taught myself HTML and CSS, I then started a short course to learn JavaScript,

I have since done a few projects such as help others build an online presence by designing their website or helping with the front end development as a freelance, I also helped a start-up financial advice service build its online website and mobile app,

My love for creating never stops, if I'm not designing prototypes or improving my coding, I'm indulging in my favourite hobby, photography. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing a website
